# Operating System Project

A simulation of an operating system with scheduler, a memory manager and a synchronizer.

* The scheduler can perform 3 scheduling algorithms:
	- Highest Priority First (HPF)
	- Shortest Remaining Time Next (SRTN)
	- Round Robin (RR)
* The memory manager using the Buddy alocation system to allocated processes in a 1024 Bytes memory.
* The synchronizer solves the famous producer-consumer problem.
